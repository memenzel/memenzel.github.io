Here, we use meteorological reanalysis, comprehensive climate models, and an idealized atmospheric model to examine the cause of the distinct behavior of the STJ and HC. We find that a decoupling of phiHC and phiSTJ can occur in a dry general circulation model, indicating that large-scale dynamical processes are sufficient to reproduce the metrics' relationship without explicit variability in the zonal structure, convective processes, or sea surface temperature variability. With that said, a phiHC and phiSTJ disconnect is dependent on the model simulating an accurate climatological basic state. Comparison of model configurations reveals that a strong coupling between the two features is the result of the eddy momentum convergence being the dominant contribution to meridional flow balance. When angular momentum advection relevantly impacts meridional flow in the subtropical upper troposphere, phiSTJ is disconnected from phiHC. This result confirms the long-held acceptance that the STJ's behavior is connected to angular momentum advection by the HC while rejecting the assumption that the phiHC and phiSTJ must therefore co-vary.","tags":[],"title":"A Refined View of the Subtropical Jet and Hadley Cell Coupling","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Communicating Climate Science was taught to upper level undergraduate students in the fall of 2020 and is being taught as a freshmen seminar in the fall of 2021.

One difficulty in constraining the answer to these enquiries is the wide range of metrics researchers use to define the edge of the Tropics. A recent publication (linked above) highlights the discrepancies between the many metrics and explains how those discrepancies have led to differing conclusions on the tropical expansion. Particularly there is a disconnect between \u0026ldquo;lower\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;upper\u0026rdquo; tropospheric metrics. It is suggested that the upper metrics are more closely related to stratospheric circulation whereas the lower metrics are representative of tropospheric circulation.

That is, as the upper branch of the Hadley Cell circulates from the equator to the subtropics, its radius to the axis of rotation of the Earth decreases thus the zonal flow in the circulation must increase to maintain angular momentum. In doing so, there is a maximum in upper tropospheric wind at the edge of the Hadley cell. However, analysis of the subtropical jet in output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) do not support this theoretical explanation of the jet’s existance.

In order to do so, we must identify the necessary model processes to decouple the subtropical jet from the Hadley Cell, and thus replicate that which is shown in CMIP5 analysis.

These direct effects are defined as the climate changes that result from forcing on a fast time scale of about a year, independent of the slower surface warming that the forcing also provokes. To evaluate how these direct effects impact ocean heat uptake and circulation, output of atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) simulations are used to force an ocean GCM with comprehensive boundary conditions. Perturbation simulations with the prescribed response to a quadrupling of atmospheric CO2 include altered surface winds, freshwater fluxes, downwelling shortwave radiation, and downwelling longwave cloud radiative effect. The perturbation simulations show that the intensification and poleward shift of surface winds, particularly in the Southern Ocean, strengthen the shallow overturning circulation in the tropical Pacific and deep overturning in the Atlantic. This, in turn, has a cooling effect on the global ocean at shallow depths. A two‐layer energy balance model, designed to capture transient global mean climate change, is adapted to account for the altered ocean heat uptake from direct effects. The direct change in global mean ocean heat uptake is a decrease of about 0.3 W/m2 for quadrupling of CO2, offsetting about 5% of the surface longwave forcing.","tags":[],"title":"Connecting Direct Effects of CO2 Radiative Forcing to Ocean Heat Uptake and Circulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Molly E Menzel","Darryn Waugh","Kevin Grise"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561398329,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561398329,"objectID":"8d5d21d6c27ed26525e442ec429f6379","permalink":"https://memenzel.github.io/talk/aofd_2019/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T22:43:29-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/aofd_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Major conclusions from CMIP5 analysis presented at the AOFD bi-annual conference, talk received an Outstanding Student Oral Presentation Award.","tags":[],"title":"AMS 22nd Conference on Atmospheric and Oceanic Fluid Dynamics","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Molly E Menzel","Darryn Waugh","Kevin Grise"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1545154807,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545154807,"objectID":"f95435b826b558a977ec7bdbac4a4f0d","permalink":"https://memenzel.github.io/talk/agu_2018/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T22:40:07-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/agu_2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Preliminary results from CMIP5 analysis displayed at AGU in poster presentation.","tags":[],"title":"AGU Fall Meeting 2018","type":"talk"}]
